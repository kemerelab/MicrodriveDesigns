MicrodriveDesigns
=================


This project contains numerous visualization and manufacturing designs for neural recording tetrode microdrives. Three dimensional part design files are created using [SolidWorks](http://www.solidworks.com) 2013 (during our process of learning how to use this excellent software). Printed circuit board design files are created using [EAGLE](http://www.cadsoftusa.com). 

##Directory Structure
  - Manufacturing/ contains files for manufacturing.
  - Explanatory/ contains designs and drawings which explain the drive construction process
  - EIBs/ contain 3D and PCB designs for different Electrode Interface Boards
  - LittleBits/ contains 3D designs of parts which are used to visualize a completed drive assembly
  - AssemblyTools/ contains 3D designs of tools and parts which are needed during assembly 
  - ConstructionParts/ contains 3D designs of parts used in drive construction (including acrylic blobs)
  - DrawingsAndRenders/ contains miscellaneous drawings (will probably move to Explanatory subdirectories eventually)
